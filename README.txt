Plugin for QGIS 2.0 for buffering polygon layers so the resulting features'
area is a specified percentage of the original.

Provides both a standalone dialog (in the "Vector" menu) and algorithms for
the Processing framework (under "Buffer by percentage").

The percentage can either be specified as a single value for all features,
or read from an attribute of the layer.
