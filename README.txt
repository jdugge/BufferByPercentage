Plugin for QGIS for buffering polygon layers so the resulting features'
area is a specified percentage of the original.

This plugin provides algorithms for
the Processing framework (under "Buffer by percentage").

The percentage can either be specified as a single value for all features,
or read from an attribute of the layer.
